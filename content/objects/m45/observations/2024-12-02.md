notes: |
  Excellent seeing conditions with no moon. First attempt as DSO photography.
  
  Used very fast exposure time: 1.5s with ~200 frames, ~150 useable. <br />
  Same night as Andromeda shoot, also took only darks, no bias or flats. <br />
  A bit nicer processing than Andromeda, but still very noisy: will likely try to reprocess with PixInsight and update the description if I reuppload. <br />
  But! You can even see some faint nebulosity of the cluster, yay!
