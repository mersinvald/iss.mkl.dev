  Crab HOO narrowband through a 3nm filter, Bortle 8
  
  Processing workflow in PixInsight 1.9.3:
  - SpectrophotometricColorCalibration (SCC) for accurate color rendition
  - NoiseXTerminator for noise reduction
  - BlurXTerminator for deconvolution and sharpening
  - StarXTerminator for star separation
  - Statistical stretch for initial dynamic range adjustment
  - Final curves adjustments for contrast and color balance

  First multi-night imaging session since 2024 :)

  I have stupidly forgot to change the 0.8x reducer to 1x flattener before I started, and only realized that ~200 images in. Oh well, an opportunity to re-capture I guess, especially since I've just got a new set of Askar E1/E2 filters to image in HSO!
