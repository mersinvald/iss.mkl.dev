Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon is a constant companion in our night sky, influencing tides, cultural mythology, and human exploration.

The Moon is a rocky, airless world that has been a source of wonder, scientific exploration, and human achievement. As Earth's only natural satellite, it has played a crucial role in human understanding of astronomy, space exploration, and our planet's natural systems.

First visited by humans on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, the Moon has been the target of numerous scientific missions. Its surface is marked by craters, mountains, and vast plains called maria, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. The lunar surface provides a detailed record of the solar system's bombardment history, with impact craters preserving billions of years of cosmic history.

The Moon's gravitational influence is critical to Earth, stabilizing our planet's axial tilt and creating the rhythm of ocean tides. It has been a central figure in human culture, mythology, and scientific exploration, from ancient civilizations tracking lunar cycles to modern space exploration and potential future human settlements.

Its phases, caused by its orbit around Earth and the changing angles of sunlight, have been a fundamental part of human timekeeping, agricultural practices, and cultural traditions throughout human history.
