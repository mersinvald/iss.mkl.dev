  Excellent seeing conditions with no moon. First attempt as DSO photography. Used very fast exposure, and took arount 100 frames,
  but only 50 turned out useable. <br />
  For stacking, took dark frames, but omitted flats and biases, which likely was a bit of a mistake. <br />
  Very heavily overprocessed in Affinity Photo 2, just to see some detail on the galaxy. Honestly, very happy with getting even this result on my first try! But there's much room for improvement... :)
