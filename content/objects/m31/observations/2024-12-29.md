  Chasing M31 finally paid off with something I'm proud to show.

  With autoguider properly callibrated this time, and using multi-star tracking, the correction curves looked very decent, and dithering worked well too. I took 90s exposures, and dithered every 4 frames. Balance on RA axis was a bit off, so dithering took a bit too much time to settle, had to bump the timeout up to 1.5 minutes, cutting effective imaging time. <br />
  The image was processed with PixInsight: GraXpert, BlurXT, StarXT, DSE, Curves.

  Power also got an upgrade: with a 50m power cable and an invertor, I no longer need to stress about battery life. Hybrid Rav4 is a surprisingly efficient power generator -- unlike with a regular gas car, the engine only runs once the HV battery is depleated, to bump the charge up a little, and then turns the engine back off. <br />
  I later install it properly, with bolt-on terminals and a 6AWG cable, giving plenty of headroom for any astro kit power requirements, and some more.
