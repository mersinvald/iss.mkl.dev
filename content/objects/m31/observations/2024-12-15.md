  First time out with SkyWatcher GTi. 3 hours spent trying to polar align with zero Polaris visibility, duuuh. Site is too bright as is, and it also was a full moon night, with cloudy skies. Conditions 0/10, won't recommend. Experience 10/10, testing new toys is always fun, especially with a friend.

  After 3-ish hours of trying to align with sub-arcmin error, and then to get autofocusing to work, I left it to shoot as is, and got around 200 frames before we had to pack up and leave. 

  Only 91 useable, processed in PixInsight trial, which I loved: very smooth experience, even if the learning curve is a bit steep. With AI denoisers, background removers, starnet, etc, integrated, making the final touch ups and getting the image to look like somewhat resembling a galaxy was pretty easy overall.

  Now I'm restless to go again, to a darker site, with better weather and moon conditions, get this thing correctly polar aligned, and shoot some long exposures of M31, to see how long I can get away with without a guider.

  Also, note to self: figure out exposure, the details will appear with longer exposures, but galaxy core shoudn't be overexposed.

  Shout out to Cuiv, and his excellent beginner's guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCotRiUIWtg&t=5513s
